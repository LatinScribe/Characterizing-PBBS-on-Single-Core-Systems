# Characterizing PBBS on single-core systems

### Abstract:

The Problem Based Benchmark Suite (PBBS) is a collection of benchmark problems defined in terms of I/O specification
with varying algorithms and implementations [1]. This paper
aims to provide a workload characterization of the PBBS
benchmark suite for single-core systems. We explore different
configurations of input set, we contrast in-order and out-oforder pipelining, and we investigate different cache configurations.
